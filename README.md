# scRNAseq ITH

This repo contains the code, data, and supplemental information for the manuscript: 

Ferrall-Fairbanks MC, Ball M, Padron E, and Altrock PM. [Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing experiments to model intratumor heterogeneity](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.18.00074). JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics. (2019) doi:10.1200/CCI.18.00074

Code is written in both R and Mathematica. 

## Getting Started

The first place to look is in the `Pipelines` directory, where you can run the main pipelines using RStudio.

Then you can reproduce each figure using the notebook in the FigureX directory. For example `Figure2`.
