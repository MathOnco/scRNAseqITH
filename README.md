# scRNAseq

This repo contains the code and data for the paper: Leveraging single cell RNA sequencing experiments to model intra-tumor heterogeneity. Code is written in both R and Mathematica. 

## Getting Started

The first place to look is in the `Pipelines` directory, where you can run the main pipelines using RStudio.

Then you can reproduce each figure using the notebook in the FigureX directory. For example `Figure2`.
